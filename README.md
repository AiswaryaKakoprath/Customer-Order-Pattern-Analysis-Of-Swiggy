# Food Ordering App Analytics Project 

### Objective:

This project revolves around analyzing data from a food ordering app using SQL. The primary objective was to delve into the dataset, understand the ordering patterns, and derive actionable insights to optimize operations and enhance customer satisfaction.

### Approach:

* Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Before analysis, meticulous data cleaning and preparation were conducted to ensure accuracy and readiness. Duplicate rows were removed to streamline the dataset and avoid redundancy, setting the stage for meaningful analysis.

* Analysis Techniques:
Utilizing various SQL techniques such as common table expressions, window functions (e.g., rank() over(partition by)), nested queries, conditional statements (CASE), joins, grouping, and ordering, a comprehensive analysis was performed. These techniques facilitated the extraction of valuable insights from the dataset.

* Key Analysis Insights:

  * Latest Order Placed: Determining the latest order placed by customers provided insights into recent ordering trends and customer engagement.
  * Outlet-wise Order and Bill Analysis: Analyzing order count, cumulative order count, total bill amount, and cumulative bill amount on an outlet-wise basis shed light on outlet performance and revenue generation.
  * Order Summary: Printing an order summary to check order status helped in monitoring and managing orders efficiently.
  * Customer-wise Outlet Analysis: Utilizing crosstabs to represent the total number of orders and total sales on a customer-wise and outlet-wise basis enabled a deeper understanding of customer preferences and outlet performance.
    
* Visualization and Presentation:
The analysis outputs were exported into Excel for further processing and visualization. Suitable charts such as line charts, Gantt bar charts, clustered column charts, and stacked column charts were created to visually represent the insights derived from the SQL analysis.

### Conclusion:

This project showcases the power of SQL in extracting insights from large datasets and driving informed decision-making in the realm of food ordering apps. By leveraging advanced SQL techniques and visualization tools, actionable insights were derived to optimize operations, improve customer experiences, and drive business growth.
